# Configuration file for the parser. In addition to parser_config.txt, this
# file maintains semantics information regarding the productions of the
# grammar, and has to be kept in sync all the time with parser_config.txt. For
# example, we need to distinguish between binary and unary operators. We also
# might need to ommit certain symbols during the creation of the AST, as for
# example the parentheses.

# Each line is of the form
#
#     <type> : <command>
#
# where type is the type of the semantic information in the line. Right now the
# only supported types are 0 - unary left operator (by default all operators
# are binary), and 1 - unused terminal
