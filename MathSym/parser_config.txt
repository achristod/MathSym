# Configuration file for the parser. Specifies the CFG grammar that is used to
# parse each command. The application is based on LL(1) grammar, so it is
# necessary to keep the productions right-recursive and backtrack-free. Each
# line specifies a production, and is of the form
#
#     A -> b1 b2 ... bn
#
# where A is a nonterminal symbol and each bi is either a terminal or a
# nonterminal symbol. By convention, the start symbol is the left-hand-side
# symbol in the first production. The special epsilon symbol for the empty
# string is denoted by ^e$.
